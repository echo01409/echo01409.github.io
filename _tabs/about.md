My name is Ben Hopkins. I have been working in various cyber domains including GRC, Threat Intelligence, Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering. In addition, I have exposure to setting up servers and infrasturcture, and performing adversary emulation of threat actors using custom-built malware and C2 frameworks.

I currently work at [Immersive](https://www.immersivelabs.com/) on the Cyber Threat Intelligence team, which also doubles up as a research and development team - which means I get to work on many interesting and varied projects. My blog reflects this cross functional nature, and although the meat and potatoes of my blog will be CTI and malware related, other interesting things will inevitably trickle in.

I have spoken on a number of webinars about malware and cyber threat intelligence, if you're interested, check out this webinar I spoke on from the [Immersive Community - The Human Connection](https://community.immersivelabs.com/event/community-events/operational-cti-lessons-from-the-attacks-that-didn%E2%80%99t-target-you/1573) on what you can learn about attacks that didn't target you.

If you wish to contact me, my Linkedin is provided on this site in the left-hand paign.
