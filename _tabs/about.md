After transitioning from a career in Policing, I found cybersecurity. By training myself up on Youtube and sitting a couple of certification exams, I was able to land a job as a Junior GRC analyst at Immersive Labs.

Allot has changed since then, where I've taken my intelligence and criminal investigation experience I got in Policing, and my criminology and psychology knowledge I gained through my degree and brought it into cybersecurity - by becoming a Cyber Threat Intelligence Researcher.

As such, my main areas of interest cover cyber threat intelligence, intelligence studies, cybercrime (including cryptocurrencies use in enabling crime), geopolitics, and reverse engineering - particularly RATS and stealers. I also have a healthy interest in red teaming through threat led testing, using adversarial TTPs to map attack flows for detection engineering.

In my spare time, I love to read and study treatise on hisotry, philosophy, and warfare - like the Art of War, The Prince, Meditations, and the works of Cassius Dio. I'm also a massive Warhammer nerd and have been building, painting, and playing the game for over 13 years.

I have established this blog as a place to conduct research, analyse malware, and share threat intelligence. Any opinions expressed in this blog are solely my own and do not represent my employer in any way.
