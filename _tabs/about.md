My name is Ben Hopkins. I have been working in various cyber domains including GRC, Threat Intelligence, Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering. In addition, I have exposure to setting up servers and infrasturcture, and performing adversary emulation of threat actors using custom-built malware and C2 frameworks.

This website is my technical blog. It represents my learning journey across my cyber career, allows me to pursue areas of interest to me outside of work hours, and serves as a repository of things I learn. The thing is, why should my learning be private? There are tousands of people out there who can benefit from my faliures and successes.

To get the most out of this website, please read on, as I have organised the blogs on this website in a clear way that allows you, the reader to decide on what you want to read depedning on your use case, as I cover various topic areas.


## RE Snapshot Series

My main interest in cyber is malware. With that being said, I want to share my interest and passion for malware analysis and reverse-engineering. I will be sharing specific techniques how to analyse malware of certain kinds, defeat key techniques, and identify indicators of compromise. Example topics for this series can include:

* Identifying Process Injection in Malware
* Defating JavaScript Obfuscation
* Debugging a DLL
* Analyzing MAC Malware
* Identifying Obfuscation Routines in PE malware
* Writing custom malware samples for detection-engineering and adversary emulation, covering specific offensive techniques

The above list in non-exxhaustive and should hopefully serve to show you the *type* of content you can expect to see for this series.


## Fundamentals Series

The fundamentals series is for things I have nailed down knoweldge wise. Specifically, these are blogs that are specifically written to showcae my knowledge of cyber fundamentals, and are there to teach readers about certain topics, such topics could include:

* PE file structure
* MAC OS Archietecture
* Introduction to Assembly Language
* Introduction to Active Directory
* CTI Core Pripciples

The above list in non-exxhaustive and should hopefully serve to show you the *type* of content you can expect to see for this series.


## Cyber Warfare

This series will cover the threat actors and geopolitics of cybersecurity. A lot of cyber threat actors tracked today are either high-performing e-crime groups or nation-state sponsored actors. This series will cover many of their campaigns and techniques in an easy to read, digestable format. Such topics of discussion can include:

* State Sponsored Financial Attacks
* Election Hacking
* Human-Driven Ransomware
* Phishing and Malvertising for Initial Access
* How organised crime fuels the cyber war machine

The above list in non-exxhaustive and should hopefully serve to show you the *type* of content you can expect to see for this series.


## Unordered titles

Any blogs that fall under this category are not as organised as the other collections. The structure is somewhat looser in writing style, along with being more conversational. These blogs will cover things like specific tools, tevhniques, or things that I have learned. These could be:

* A blog about a malware campaign where I have analysed the sample(s), and have learned things along the way. Both my successes and faliures will be in here
* A blog covering a specific tool, like using Volatiltiy for malware analysis
* Non-technical blogs about how to stufy for certifications, and how to go about getting a cyber role
* Building custom tooling like a custom C2 framework

The above list in non-exxhaustive and should hopefully serve to show you the *type* of content you can expect to see.
