My name is Ben Hopkins. I have been working in various cyber domains including GRC, Threat Intelligence, Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering. In addition, I have exposure to setting up servers and infrasturcture, and performing adversary emulation of threat actors using custom-built malware and C2 frameworks.

I currently work at [Immersive Labs](https://www.immersivelabs.com/) on the Cyber Threat Intelligence team, which also doubles up as a research and development team - which means I get to work on many interesting and varied projects. My blog reflects this cross functional nature, and although the meat and potatoes of my blog will be CTI and malware related, other interesting things will inevitably trickle in.

If you're interested to know what exactly my role on the CTI team entails, check out this webinar I spoke on from the [Immersive Labs Community](https://community.immersivelabs.com/event/community-events/operational-cti-how-immersive-builds-labs-for-real-world-threat-preparedness/1131)

If you wish to contact me, my Linkedin is provided on this site in the left-hand paign.
