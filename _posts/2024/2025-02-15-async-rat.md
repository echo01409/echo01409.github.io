AsyncRAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) built to remotely monitor and control other computers through a secure, encrypted connection. The name "AsyncRAT" comes from its core functionalityâ€”'async' means it performs its operations asynchronously, which means it is capable of executing several tasks simultaneously. AsyncRAT has been observed as being bought, sold, and deployed for years, going through many versions and renditions. Functionality associated with AsyncRAT includes keylogging, remote desktop control, and the ability to enumerate a victim machine and exfiltraing stolen data - among other fucntionality.

In this post, we'll look at the newest version or AsyncRAT, and use this as an opportunity to document what a good process for analysing a trojan looks like. We'll also go over what to expect in terms of output, that being the tangible things we get from analysing trojans.
