AsyncRAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) built to remotely monitor and control other computers through a secure, encrypted connection. The name "AsyncRAT" comes from its core functionalityâ€”'async' means it performs its operations asynchronously, which means it is capable of executing several tasks simultaneously. AsyncRAT has been observed as being bought, sold, and deployed for years, going through many versions and renditions. Functionality associated with AsyncRAT includes keylogging, remote desktop control, and the ability to enumerate a victim machine and exfiltraing stolen data - among other fucntionality.

In this post, we'll look at the newest version or AsyncRAT, and use this as an opportunity to document what a good process for analysing a trojan looks like. We'll also go over what to expect in terms of output, that being the tangible things we get from analysing trojans.

And I promise that by the end of this you won't look like our Skaven friend, pictured below. I am a huge Warhammer nerd so I expect little bits with filter into the blogs!

## Initialisation

In January 2019 AsyncRAT was released as an open source remote administration tool project on [GitHub](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/AsyncRAT-C-Sharp). Since then, threat actors and adversaries have used several interesting script loaders and spear phishing attachments to deliver AsyncRAT to targeted hosts or networks in different campaigns over the years. This blog will focus specifically on AsyncRAT rather than its delivery mechanisms.

AsyncRAT begins it's execution process by sleeping for one second before going through the rest of its initialisation, it is unclear why this happens. In addition, AsyncRAT initialises itself using its settings, and if this errors in any way, AsyncRAT terminates.

```cs
{
	for (int i = 0; i < Convert.ToInt32(Settings.Delay); i++)
	{
		Thread.Sleep(1000);
	}
	if (!Settings.InitializeSettings())
	{
		Environment.Exit(0);
	}
```

Talk next about the configuration Settings class, and the obfuscation (used the builder to compare and contrast since it was available on Github... but also provide a way for deobfuscating...)
