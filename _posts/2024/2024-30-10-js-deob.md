With JavaScript being a popular programming language used in many web technologies, it often gets used by threat actors as initial stage payloads. Such scripts could have Powershell code embedded in them, further malware stagers, or functions for downloading malware from an attacker's C2 server. Because JavaScript is a high-level language, it's human-readable and logically easy to understand, so threat actors find ways to obfuscate (hide from an analyst) what the code is doing. In this blog, I'll cover some real JavaScript from the wild that was used to download and run a PikaBot variant. I'll cover my methodology, where I went wrong, and some learning points for you, the reader, to take away and apply to your own analysis.

## Why Obfuscate code at all?

As a quick primer, its worth covering why threat actors bother obfuscating their scripts and malware in the first place; The main reason is time. The more time it takes an analyst to work out what the malware is doing, the more time the attackers has to run their attack flow on your network.

Your job as an analyst is to work out what the attacker is doing as soon as possible, and this often means modifying the code to add a print statement (`console.log` in JS) to the end of obfuscated functions and dynamically running the code in a sandbox, letting the code deobfuscate itself as it'll need to do that to run it. The problem is, if the code is so obfuscated that you can't understand any of it, how do you know where to add your statements, or where to start and stop the program?

This was the case with a sample I recently played with, the obfuscation itself wasn't complicated, but it was messy, and if you don't know what your doing this type of obfuscation can overwhelm you. In this blog I will show you the general method I take to analysing JavaScript, or any programming language - and how these methods could be optimised and improved to be more time efficient.
